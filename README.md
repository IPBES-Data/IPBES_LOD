## IPBES Linked Open Data

To make the IPBES assessment reports more accessible and searchable, we have brought them into a machine-readable interlinked data format that can be freely used and distributed, known as Linked Open Data.

All reports are mapped to the LOD format based on the IPBES ontology we have developed. More information about the ontology can be found at: https://github.com/IPBES-Data/IPBES_Ontology

Three reports are available in ttl format to date:
- the [First Global Assessment](https://github.com/IPBES-Data/IPBES_LOD/blob/main/Global%20Assessment%201/README.md) (GA1)
- the [Values Assessment](https://github.com/IPBES-Data/IPBES_LOD/tree/main/Values%20Assessment) (VA)
- the [Invasive Alien Species Assessment](https://github.com/IPBES-Data/IPBES_LOD/tree/main/Invasive%20Alien%20Species%20Assessment) (IAS).

More details on each assessment can be found in the corresponding folder.
